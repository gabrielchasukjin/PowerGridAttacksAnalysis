## Introduction 
Power outages can have a significant economic impact, as they can disrupt business operations and cause a loss of revenue. The rise in severe outages over the recent decades should not be overlooked. 

Specifically, there has been a rise of intentional attacks on power grids. Interestingly, these attacks have been clustered around certain US States, such as Washington and Iowa. Are these states experiencing a rise in attacks by chance alone, or is there something bigger at play? 


## Cleaning and EDA
### Univariate Analysis
#### Outage Distribution
As shwon in the distribution, most of the outages are clustered in the front. This means that majority of outages lasted less than 2000 minutes. More specifcally, 64.67% of all outages are in the very first `[0, 1999)` bin. Outlier: The longest outage lasted 108653 minutes (roughly 4527 Days and 5 Hours) caused from a fuel supply emergency in Wisconsin.
#### Causality Barchart
As shown in the distribution, outages are most commonly caused from severe weather. Specifcally, 49.74% of outages are due to severe weather. Intentional attacks is the second main leading cause outages, making up 27.25% of the recorded outages in the dataset.
#### Location of Outages 
As shwon in the bar chart, California is the leading state with the most outages (13.69% of all recorded outages). The second leading state with the most outages is Texas, making up 8.28% of all outages. Alaska comes last with one reported outage.
